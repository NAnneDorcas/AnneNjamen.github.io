			<h2>Project overview</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			The purpose of this project is to make an xArm clean a whiteboard most efficiently with only using one sensor, 
			the camera. There will be some differently coloured lines on the whiteboard, the camera will detect them and 
			the image will be processed. The robot will clean the board using that information. The robot will only clean 
			if something is drawn on the whiteboard and only the areas that have a drawing. The robot will stop once the 
			board is fully clean. The area of vision is determined by the user and the xArm only wipes the specified area.
			 The robot will check every "time interval" if something has been drawn on the board. If there is an obstacle 
			 in front of the robot it will not start cleaning the board until the obstacle is gone and it identifies the 
			 drawing.
