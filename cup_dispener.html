    <h1>Use of smart devices (smart switches) to facilitate the use of machine dispenser (cup dispenser)</h1>
    <p><h4>The problem:</h4> A cup dispenser is operated by a smart watch. The operation is not reliable, and the 
		customer is complaining. The problem is not so much the dispenser side. That works fine more or less. It 
		has to do with back-end communication. 
	</p>
	<p><h4>task:</h4> Answer the question how does the dispenser and the app/phone interact with each other? Do 
		research and dig into the topic. Build a cloud where the dispenser and phones can be connected to have 
		better access to the dispenser QR code. In short make the machine give a cup from your phone How 
		does my part integrate with that of the concept of the project: help the team by doing a practical search 
		of what the problem may be and provide a theoretical solution to what the problem may be and the 
		corresponding solutions to the problem.</p>
