    <h1>Use of smart devices (smart switches) to facilitate the use of machine dispenser (cup dispenser)</h1>
</header>
<body>
    <p><h4>The problem:</h4> A cup dispenser is operated by a smart watch. The operation is not reliable, and the 
		customer is complaining. The problem is not so much the dispenser side. That works fine more or less. It 
		has to do with back-end communication. 
	</p>
	<p><h4>task:</h4> Answer the question how does the dispenser and the app/phone interact with each other? Do 
		research and dig into the topic. Build a cloud where the dispenser and phones can be connected to have 
		better access to the dispenser QR code. In short make the machine give a cup from your phone How 
		does my part integrate with that of the concept of the project: help the team by doing a practical search 
		of what the problem may be and provide a theoretical solution to what the problem may be and the 
		corresponding solutions to the problem.

			<h4>Working mechanism:</h4>
		</header>
		<p>The business idea presented here revolves around replacing disposable plastic packaging with reusable 
			dishes, while maintaining a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers of food in disposable 
			packaging. The implementation involves individual QR code labels on each cup. When a customer 
			purchases coffee, they scan the QR code using the company's app, which deducts a deposit from their 
			wallet. Collection boxes are provided for cup returns, and upon returning the cup, the deposit is 
			refunded. Additionally, there is a service fee for the coffee maker, but specific details about it are not 
			provided. The dispenser itself also features a QR label that customers can scan to obtain a cup.</p>

			<h4>Here are a few ways the switch could be used:</h4>
		</header>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h5>Cup Dispenser Mechanism:</h5>
				<p>The eWeLink Smart Rolling Door Switch or WiFi Relay could be used to 
					control the opening and closing of the cup dispenser mechanism. By connecting the switch to the 
					dispenser's motor, it could enable remote or automated control of the dispensing process.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Remote Operation:</h5>
				<p>Through the eWeLink mobile app or other compatible applications, users could 
					remotely trigger the dispenser to dispense a cup. This could be achieved by sending a command to the 
					switch, which would activate the dispenser motor and release a cup. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Integration with QR Code System:</h5>
				<p> The dispenser could be equipped with QR code labels similar to the 
					reusable cups mentioned in the previous context. When a user wants a cup, they can scan the QR code 
					on the dispenser using the app. The app would then send a command to the switch, initiating the cup 
					dispensing process.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Monitoring and Inventory Management: </h5>
				<p>The WiFi Relay could also facilitate monitoring and inventory 
					management of the cup dispenser. It could provide data on the number of cups dispensed, track usage 
					patterns, and send notifications when the cup supply needs to be replenished.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Backend solutions:</h5>
				<p>Backend Infrastructure Upgrade: Propose upgrading the backend infrastructure, 
					including servers, networking equipment, and databases, to ensure optimal performance and reliability. 
					This may involve investing in more powerful hardware, increasing bandwidth capacity, or implementing 
					load balancing techniques to handle higher communication loads. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Data Transfer Protocol Optimization:</h5>
				<p>Investigate the data transfer protocols used for communication 
					between the cup dispenser and the backend server. Explore alternative protocols or optimization 
					techniques, such as compression algorithms or data caching, to improve the efficiency and speed of 
					communication.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms:</h5>
				<p>Suggest implementing robust error handling and retry 
					mechanisms in the cup dispenser's software or firmware. This could involve incorporating mechanisms 
					to detect and handle communication errors, retry failed requests, and provide appropriate error 
					messages to users.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:</h5>
				<p> Propose implementing a system for real-time monitoring of the 
					backend communication. This could involve setting up monitoring tools to track communication metrics, 
					such as response times and error rates. Additionally, configure alerts or notifications to be triggered 
					when communication issues arise, allowing for prompt investigation and resolution.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Communication Redundancy:</h5>
				<p>Recommend introducing redundancy measures to mitigate 
					communication failures. This could involve implementing backup servers, redundant network 
					connections, or failover mechanisms to ensure continuous communication even in the event of system 
					failures or disruptions.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Code Optimization and Performance Tuning:</h5>
				<p>Suggest reviewing and optimizing the codebase of the 
					cup dispenser's software or firmware. Identify areas of inefficiency or bottlenecks in the communication 
					logic and propose improvements to enhance overall performance and responsiveness.</p>
			</li>

			<li><h4>In-depth smart switch:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Physical layer/Data Link communication: Wireless - WiFi 602001...</li>
					<li>Protocol/Network Layer: IoT protocol implemented in smart switch - e.g MQTT, CoAP if they're using 
						IoT protocols in this case. In many cases, they use TCP/IP protocol(Internet protocol).
						</li>
					<li>To troubleshoot physical, datalink, and network layers, use tools such as PostMan to see if you can 
						send and receive standard messages from the smart switch using its gateway IP address.
						</li>
					<li>Transport/Session layer : How does the IoT protocol handle user requests: UDP(not reliable), TCP(3-
						way communication protocol). Next steps: - Follow guide on connecting eW-Link to smart switch.

		<h3>Alternative to using other sensors than light sensors as a way to know all the cups are dispensed</h3>
		<p>Most vending machine sensors use passive infrared (PIR) sensors, which unlike optical sensors that use 
			an LED transmitter and infrared receiver, emit nothing.
		</p>
		<p>Types of sensors I can use</p>
		<ol>
			<li><h5>Weight or Load Sensors(an option only if we want to put something to close the dispenser from the 
				bottom):
				</h5>
				<p>Load cells are sensors that can measure the weight or load applied to them. Placing a load cell under the 
					cup stack can help determine if cups are present. When the dispenser is empty, the load cell will register 
					a minimal load, indicating that it's time to refill the cups.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Advantages load cells
						<ul>
							<li>Strain gauge load cells can be use for weighing purposes.
							</li>
							<li>Strain gauge load cells can also be use for material testing in process industry also.
							</li>
							<li> Strain gauge load cells are also used in tensile test machines as a major component.
							</li>
							<li>Strain gauge load cells can be used for both expansion and compression.</li>
							<li>Strain gauge load cells are less costly so mostly used in the industry</li>
							<li>Strain gauge load cells are used in automotive industry to check the structural performances of the 
								material used in doors, hoods, trunksetc.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Disadvantages load cells
						<ul>
							<li>It requires continuous electric energy for the production and display of signals.</li>
							<li>It also requires an amplification circuit for the generation of output display because the signals 
								produced by the gauge itself are of very much low voltage almost in milli volts.</li>
							<li>It cannot be used for the pressure measurement of highly reactive or corrosive materials because 
								they can damage the gauge</li>
							<li>It cannot be used for the measurement of very high pressure if the diaphragm use is of plastic.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Counting Sensors
				</h5>
				<p>Implement a counting mechanism that counts the number of cups dispensed. For example, you can use 
					an encoder or rotary encoder to keep track of each cup dispensed. When the count reaches zero or falls 
					below a certain threshold, it indicates that the dispenser is empty.
					An encoder is a motion sensor that generates digital signals in response to motion (1). Encoders can 
					provide users with information on the position, velocity and/or direction of all types of machinery 
					(2). Encoders are generally used to measure one or more specific parameters about the object, such as 
					its velocity, position, direction, or to provide a count of the object or some related value.
					Simply put, an encoder is a sensing device that provides feedback. Encoders convert motion to an 
					electrical signal that can be read by some type of control device in a motion control system, such as a 
					counter or PLC. The encoder sends a feedback signal that can be used to determine position, count, 
					speed, or direction
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Advantages 
						<ul>
							<li>Highly reliable and accurate.
							</li>
							<li>Higher resolution.
							</li>
							<li>Low-cost feedback.
							</li>
							<li>Integrated electronics.</li>
							<li>Compact in size.</li>
							<li>Fuses optical and digital technology.</li>
							<li>It can be incorporated into existing applications.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Disadvantages 
						<ul>
							<li>The subject of magnetic radio interference.</li>
							<li>Susceptible to dirt, oil and dust contamination.</li>
							<li>Direct light source interference.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Proximity Sensors(same as phone using sensors to turn off when on the phone e.g Ultrasonic or 
				infrared sensor)
				</h5>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ultrasonic Sensors: Ultrasonic sensors emit high-frequency sound waves and measure the time it 
							takes for the sound waves to bounce back. They can be positioned at the bottom of the cup 
							dispenser to detect the presence or absence of cups. When the dispenser is empty, the absence 
							of cups will result in a longer travel time for the sound waves, triggering an empty status.
						</li>
						<li>Infrared Sensors: Infrared (IR) proximity sensors emit infrared light and detect reflections. By 
							placing an IR sensor at the bottom of the dispenser, you can detect when there are no cups to 
								reflect the infrared beam. When the beam is interrupted, it indicates that the dispenser is 
							empty.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Advantages of proximity sensor
						<ul>
							<li>It can detect both metallic and nonmetallic targets.</li>
							<li>It has good stability</li>
							<li>High speed provided.</li>
							<li>High switching rate.</li>
							<li>Work in harsh environmental conditions.</li>
							<li>Low cost and power consumption.</li>
							<li>capacitive sensor is good in terms of power usage.</li>
							<li>They are useful and can help with many security problems.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Disadvantages of proximity sensor
						<ul>
							<li>They are affected by temperature and humidity.
							</li>
							<li>Difficulties in designing.
							</li>
							<li> Strain gauge load cells are also used in tensile test machines as a major component.
							</li>
							<li>The operating range may be limited.</li>
							<li>A capacitive proximity sensor is not as accurate compared to the inductive sensors.
							</li>
							<li>It detects only the metallic target.
							</li>
							<li>They can be easily set off and cause a problem.
							</li>
							<li>They are expensive than inductive and capacitive sensors.
							</li>
						</ul>
